## LinearClassifier

This library implements linear classification for numerical data. It accepts two labeled data sets, each element of which can contain two or more floats as data. Once trained, LinearClassifier can predict which of the two original sets any new piece of test data will fall into.  LinearClassifier also includes tools for displaying data in the 2D case. See the 2D example for details.

LinearClassifier is based on examples in Chapter 9 of [Programming Collective by Toby Segaran](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do).
